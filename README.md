# TravelTracker
The Travel Tracker app provides an easy-to-use way of managing both prospective and past-visited places all over the globe. Users will be able to mark locations where they either have visited or would like to visit. There is also a useful journal feature where users will be able to rate and describe their experiences at places where they have already visited as well as save notes on locations they are looking forward to visiting in the future.

## Layout
The layout of the software is super simple and has three main screens that the user can go to.

### Map
With the included map, users can search for places that they would like to visit in the future.

### Places I've Been
This is where users will post the places that they've visited and give them a score and a description. This will help them keep track of the places they've visited as well as help others decide if the place is worth visiting.

### Places to Visit
Similar to the Places I've Been screen, this screen will have the places that the user favourited and would like to visit in the future. The user will easily see the average score of the place and decide if it is worth going to.
